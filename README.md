vagrant-geteventstore
=====================

Vagrant environments for GetEventStore

To use this you need to run the command:

    vagrant up --provider=vmware_fusion
    
More boxes will appear here for virtualbox etc. This is very much a testbed right now so use with caution. IT IS NOT PRODUCTION READY AT ALL
